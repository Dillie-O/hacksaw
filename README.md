HackSaw is a web based tool for viewing log files created with the Log4Net framework.

HackSaw leverages .NET 2.0 and AJAX technologies to provide a fast and intuitive interface to search and view log files generated with the log4net framework.

Note: An updated Quick Start Guide I wrote for Log4Net can be found here: http://dillieodigital.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/log4net-a-quick-start-guide/
